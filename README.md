# Dechirping Efficiency
This repository contains code to compute the dechirping efficiency (Margot et al. 2020) of radio technosignature data-processing pipelines such as those used by the Breakthrough Listen team in [Enriquez et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...849..104E/abstract) and [Price et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...86P/abstract).  The dechirping implemented in this notebook comes from the [turboSETI package](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti).
